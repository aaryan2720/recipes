<p><b>Ingredients: For the Sugar Cookies:</b></p>

<ul>
    <li> 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li> 1 large egg</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                        <li> ½ teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<p><b>For Decorating:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Royal icing (gray and silver)</li>
        <li>Edible silver or metallic powder</li>
            <li>Small paintbrush</li>
                <li>Piping bags or plastic squeeze bottles</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Instructions:</b></p>
<ol>
   <li><b> Prepare the Sugar Cookie Dough:</b>
<ul>
    <li>In a bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
<li>Add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</li>
<li>Gradually add the flour and salt, mixing until the dough comes together.</li>
<li>Divide the dough into two equal portions, shape them into discs, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
</ul>   
</li>


<li><b>Roll and Cut the Cookie Shapes:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Take one of the chilled dough discs and roll it out on a floured surface to about ¼-inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Use a hammer-shaped cookie cutter (or carefully cut the shape freehand with a knife) to cut out the Mjolnir hammer shapes from the dough.</li>
                <li>Transfer the cookie shapes to the prepared baking sheet, leaving a little space between each.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Bake the Cookies:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
<li>Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Decorate the Mjolnir Cookies:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Prepare your gray and silver royal icing. Use the gray icing to outline the hammer shape and create the handle of Mjolnir on the cookies.</li>
        <li>Fill in the outline with gray icing, using a toothpick or small skewer to spread it evenly.</li>
            <li>While the icing is still wet, dust the surface of the gray icing with a bit of edible silver or metallic powder to give it a metallic shine.</li>
                <li>Use the silver royal icing to add finer details, such as the cracks and patterns on the hammer.</li>
                    <li>Let the icing dry and set completely before handling or serving.</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li><b>Serve and Enjoy:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Once the icing has dried and set, your Mjolnir's Hammer Sugar Cookies are ready to be enjoyed!</li>
        <li>Serve them at parties, gatherings, or just as a delicious treat while feeling the power of Thor's hammer in your hands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
